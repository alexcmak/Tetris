# Tetris

This is a Tetris clone written in python based on an excellent tutorial by Nick Koumaris from [Programming with Nick](https://github.com/educ8s/Python-Tetris-Game-Pygame).

You will need to have *pygame* on your computer. [Follow this guide.](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)


python is tricky on the iMac, this [link](https://hackernoon.com/fixing-the-externally-managed-environment-error-when-using-pip-a-quick-guide) helped me.


I plan on adding a few things to the game.

## Features added so far: 
- More sensible OOP division, the subclasses of Block should have its own attributes such as color and width
- P for pause game
- Pause when game over, N for new game
- Make tiles stone color when game over
- Space bar to drop
