# Tetris

This is a Tetris clone based on an excellent tutorial by Nick Koumaris from [Programming with Nick](https://github.com/educ8s/Python-Tetris-Game-Pygame).

I plan on adding a few things to the game.

Features added so far:
- More sensible OOP division, the subclasses of Block should have its own attributes such as color and width
- P for pause game
- Pause when game over, N for new game
- Make tiles stone color when game over
- Space bar to drop
